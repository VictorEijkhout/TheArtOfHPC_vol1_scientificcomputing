In this project you're asked to analyze the \acf{BSP} model, both
abstractly and by simulation.

\Level 0 {Discussion}

For your assignment you need to investigate Bulk Synchronous
Programming. Read the wikipedia article
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel} and
section~\ref{sec:bsp} in the book.  

Consider the following questions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Discuss the relation between the complexity model of BSP and the
  $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ model you learned in
  section~\ref{sec:collective-cost}.
\item \ac{BSP} uses barrier synchronisations. Are these necesary in
  practice? Consider separately two different classes of algorithms, namely
  \ac{PDE} solving, and large scale graph computations.
\end{enumerate}

\Level 0 {Simulation}

In the defining paper on \ac{BSP}, Valiant~\cite{Valiant:1990:BSP}
advocates making more tasks than processors, and distributing them
randomly. Program a simulation and test if this strategy solves the
load balance problem. Discuss the random placement strategy in the
context of various algorithms.
