Very much in progress.

Two-electron contribution to the Fock matrix (in GAMESS)

\begin{verbatim}
do ish = ISH,1 ???
  do jsh = 1,ish
    do ksh = 1,ish
      if ish==ksh
        lmax = jsh
      else
        lmax = ksh
      do lsh = 1,lmax
        test = max(D,ish,jsh,ksh,lsh) *
               max(I,ish,jsh,ksh,lsh)
        if test>cutoff
          calcuate(ish,jsh,ksh,lsh)
          call DIRFCK
\end{verbatim}

The jsh/ksh loops can be parallelized together.
The outer loop is sequential.
