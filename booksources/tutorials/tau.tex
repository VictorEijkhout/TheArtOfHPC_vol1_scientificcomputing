\index{TAU|(}

The TAU tool~\cite{TAU:ijhpca}
(see \url{http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php} for the official documentation)
uses \indexterm{instrumentation} to profile and trace your code. That is, it adds 
profiling and trace calls to your code. You can then inspect
the output after the run.

Profiling is the
gathering and displaying of bulk statistics, for instance showing you
which routines take the most time, or whether communication takes a
large portion of your runtime. When you get concerned about
performance, a good profiling tool is indispensible.

Tracing is the construction and displaying of time-dependent
information on  your program run, for instance showing you if one
process lags behind others. For understanding a program's behaviour,
and the reasons behind profiling statistics, a tracing tool can be
very insightful.

\Level 1 {merge this section}

There are two ways to instrument your code:
\begin{itemize}
\item You can use \indextermsub{dynamic}{instrumentation}, where TAU adds the measurement facility at runtime:
\begin{verbatim}
# original commandline:
% mpicxx wave2d.cpp -o wave2d
# with TAU dynamic instrumentation:
% mpirun -np 12 tau_exec ./wave2d 500 500 3 4 5
\end{verbatim}
\item You can have the instrumentation added at compile time. For
  this, you need to let TAU take over the compilation in some sense.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item TAU has its own makefiles. The names and locations depend on
    your installation, but typically it will be something like
\begin{verbatim}
export TAU_MAKEFILE=$TAU_HOME/lib/Makefile.tau-mpi-pdt
\end{verbatim}
  \item Now you can invoke the TAU compilers \n{tau_cc,sh}, \n{tau_cxx.sh}, \n{tau_f90.sh}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

When you run your program you need to tell TAU what to do:
\begin{verbatim}
export TAU_TRACE=1
export TAU_PROFILE=1
export TRACEDIR=/some/dir
export PROFILEDIR=/some/dir
\end{verbatim}

In order to generate trace plots you need to convert TAU output:
\begin{verbatim}
cd /some/dir # where the trace and profile output went
tau_treemerge.pl
tau2slog2 tau.trc tau.edf -o yourrun.slog2
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{slog2}\index{slog2 file format} file can be displayed with \indexterm{jumpshot}.

\Level 1 {Instrumentation}

Unlike such tools as \indexterm{VTune} which profile your binary as-is,
TAU works by adding \indexterm{instrumentation} to your code: in
effect it is a source-to-source translator that takes your code and
turns it into one that generates run-time statistics.

This instrumentation is largely done for you; you mostly need to recompile
your code with a script that does the source-to-source translation,
and subsequently compiles that instrumented code.
You could for instance have the following in your makefile:
\begin{verbatim}
ifdef TACC_TAU_DIR
  CC = tau_cc.sh
else
  CC = mpicc
endif

% : %.c
<TAB>${CC} -o $@ $^
\end{verbatim}
If TAU is to be used (which we detect here by checking for the environment variable
\indextermtt{TACC_TAU_DIR}), we define the \indextermtt{CC} variable as
one of the TAU compilation scripts; otherwise we set it to a regular MPI compiler.

\begin{fortrannote}{Cpp includes}
  If your source contains 
  \begin{lstlisting}
    #include "something.h" 
  \end{lstlisting}
  directives, add the option
\begin{verbatim}
  -optPreProcess
\end{verbatim}
to the TAU compiler.
\end{fortrannote}

\begin{istc}
To use \emph{TAU} on \emph{TACC}\index{TAU!on TACC resources} resources,
do \n{module load tau}.
\end{istc}

\Level 1 {Running}

You can now run your instrumented code;
trace/profile output will be written to file 
if environment variables \indextermtt{TAU_PROFILE} and/or \indextermtt{TAU_TRACE} are set:
\begin{verbatim}
export TAU_PROFILE=1
export TAU_TRACE=1
\end{verbatim}

A TAU run can generate many files: typically at least one per process.
It is therefore advisabe to create a directory for your tracing and profiling
information. You declare them to TAU by setting the environment variables
\indextermtt{PROFILEDIR} and \indextermtt{TRACEDIR}.
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir tau_trace
mkdir tau_profile
export PROFILEDIR=tau_profile
export TRACEDIR=tau_trace
\end{verbatim}

The actual program invocation is then unchanged:
\begin{verbatim}
mpirun -np 26 myprogram
\end{verbatim}

\begin{taccnote}
At TACC, use \indextermtt{ibrun} without a processor count;
the count is derived from the queue submission parameters.
\end{taccnote}

While this example uses two separate directories, there is no
harm in using the same for both.

\Level 1 {Output}

The tracing/profiling information is spread over many files, and hard to read as such.
Therefore, you need some further programs to consolidate and display the information.

You view profiling information with \indextermtt{paraprof}
\begin{verbatim}
paraprof tau_profile
\end{verbatim}
Viewing the traces takes a few steps:
\begin{verbatim}
cd tau_trace
rm -f tau.trc tau.edf align.trc align.edf
tau_treemerge.pl
tau_timecorrect tau.trc tau.edf align.trc align.edf
tau2slog2 align.trc align.edf -o yourprogram.slog2
\end{verbatim}
If you skip the \indextermtt{tau_timecorrect} step, you can generate the
\n{slog2} file by:
\begin{verbatim}
tau2slog2 tau.trc tau.edf -o yourprogram.slog2
\end{verbatim}

The \n{slog2} file can be viewed with \indextermtt{jumpshot}:
\begin{verbatim}
jumpshot yourprogram.slog2
\end{verbatim}

\Level 1 {Without instrumentation}

Event-based sampling on uninstrumented code:
\begin{verbatim}
tau_exec -ebs yourprogram
\end{verbatim}
The resulting \n{.trc} file can be viewed with \indextermtt{paraprof}.

\Level 1 {Examples}

\Level 2 {Bucket brigade}

Let's consider a \indexterm{bucket brigade} implementation of a broadcast:
each process sends its data to the next higher rank. 
%
\begin{lstlisting}
int sendto =
    ( procno<nprocs-1 ? procno+1 : MPI_PROC_NULL )
    ;
int recvfrom =
    ( procno>0 ? procno-1 : MPI_PROC_NULL )
    ;

MPI_Recv( leftdata,1,MPI_DOUBLE,recvfrom,0,comm,MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
myvalue = leftdata
MPI_Send( myvalue,1,MPI_DOUBLE,sendto,0,comm);
\end{lstlisting}

We implement the bucket brigade
with blocking sends and receives: each process waits to receive from its
predecessor, before sending to its successor.
%
\cverbatimsnippet{bucketblock}
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{tau-bucketblock}
\caption{Trace of a bucket brigade broadcast}
\label{fig:tau-bucketblock}
\end{figure}
%
The TAU trace of this is in figure~\ref{fig:tau-bucketblock},
using 4~nodes of 4~ranks each.
We see that the processes within each node are fairly well synchronized,
but there is less synchronization between the nodes.
However, the bucket brigade then imposes its own synchronization on the processes
because each has to wait for its predecessor, no matter if it posted
the receive operation early.

Next, we introduce pipelining into this operation:
each send is broken up into parts, and these parts are sent
and received with non-blocking calls.

The TAU trace is in figure~\ref{fig:tau-bucketpipe}.

\Level 2 {Butterfly exchange}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{butterfly8-legend}
\caption{Trace of a butterfly exchange}
\label{fig:tau-b8legend}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{butterfly8-gaps}
\caption{Trace of a butterfly exchange}
\label{fig:tau-b8gaps}
\end{figure}

The NAS Parallel Benchmark suite~\cite{nas-website}
contains a \ac{CG} implementation
that spells out its all-reduce operations as a
\indexterm{butterfly exchange}.

  \vskip\baselineskip
  \includegraphics[scale=.3]{cgdelay4}

  \label{fig:cgdelay2}
\end{figure}

We recognize this structure in the TAU trace: figure~\ref{fig:tau-b8legend}.
Upon closer examination, we see how this particular algorithm
induces a lot of wait time.
Figures \ref{fig:cgdelay} and \ref{fig:cgdelay2} show a whole cascade of processes
waiting for each other.
