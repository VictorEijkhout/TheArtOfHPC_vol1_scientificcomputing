In this tutorial you will learn \indextermdef{git},
the currently most popular \indexterm{version control}
(also \emph{source code control}\index{source code control|!see{version contro}}
or \emph{revision control}\index{revision control|see{version control}})
systems.
Other similar systems are \indexterm{Mercurial}
and \indextermbus{Microsoft}{Sharepoint}\index{Sharepoint|see{Microsoft, Sharepoint}}.
Earlier systems were \indexterm{SCCS}, \indexterm{CVS}, \indexterm{Subversion},
\indexterm{Bitkeeper}.

Version control is a system that tracks the history of a software project,
by recording the successive versions of the files of the project.
These versions are recorded in a \indextermdef{repository},
either on the machine you are working on, or remotely.

This has many practical advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item It becomes possible to undo changes;
\item Sharing a repository with another developer
  makes collaboration possible, including multiple edits
  on the same file.
\item A repository records the history of the project.
\item You can have multiple versions of the project,
  for instance for exploring new features,
  or for customization for certain users.
\end{itemize}

The use of a version control system is industry standard practice,
and git is by far the most popular system these days.

\Level 0 {Concepts and overview}

Older systems were based on having one \indextermsub{central}{repository},
that all developers coordinated with.
These days a setup is popular where each developer (or a small group)
has a \indextermsub{local}{repository},
which gets synchronized to a \indexterm{remote}{repository}.
In so-called \emph{distributed version control}\index{version control!distributed}
systems there can even be multiple remote repositories to synchronize with.

It is possible to track the changes of a single file,
but often it makes sense to bundle a group of changes
together in a \indexterm{commit}.
That also makes it easy to roll back such a group of changes.

If a project is in a state that constitutes some sort of a milestone,
it is possible to attach a \indexterm{tag},
or mark the state as a \indexterm{release}.

Modern version control systems allow you to have
multiple \indexterm{branch}es,
even in the same local repository.
This way you can have a main branch for the release version of the project,
and one or more development branches for exploring new features.

\Level 0 {Git}
\lstset{style=gitsession}

This lab should be done two people, to simulate a group
of programmers working on a joint project. You can also do this on
your own by using two clones of the repository, 
preferably opening two windows on your computer.

Best practices for distributed version control:
\url{https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control.html}

\Level 0 {Create and populate a repository}

\begin{purpose}
  In this section you will create a repository and make a local copy
  to work on.
\end{purpose}

You can create a repository two different ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create the remote repository and do a clone.
\item Create the repository locally, and then connect it to a remote;
  this is a lot more work.
\end{enumerate}

\Level 1 {Create a repository by cloning}

If you want to work on a repository that you have found (or created!)
on some site such as \indextermtt{github.com}, you can use
\begin{lstlisting}
    git clone URL [ localname ]
\end{lstlisting}
This gives you a directory with the contents of the repository.
If you leave out the local name, the directory will have the name
of the repository.

\begin{gitstep}{emptyclone.runout1}
  Clone an empty repository and check that it is indeed empty
\end{gitstep}

\Level 1 {Create a repository locally}

You can also create a directory for your repository,
  and connect it to a remote site later.
  For this you do \lstinline{git init}
  in the directory that is either empty,
  or already contains the material that you want to add later.
  Here, we start with an empty directory.

\begin{gitstep}{init.runout1}
  Create a directory, and nake it into a repository
\end{gitstep}

The disadvantage of this method,
over cloning an empty repo,
is that you now have to connect your directory to a remote repository.
See section~\ref{sec:git-remote}.

\Level 1 {Main vs master}

It used to be that the default branch
(yes, I~know, we haven't discussed branches yet)
was called `master'.
In a shift of terminology, the preferred name is now `main'.
Sites such as \indexterm{github} and \indexterm{gitlab}
may already create this name by default;
the git software does not do this, as of this writing in~2022.

Renaming a branch is possible.
  Use \lstinline{git status} to see what branch you are on,

\begin{gitstep}{movemaster.runout}
  See what the main branch is
\end{gitstep}

Move the current branch with
\begin{lstlisting}
  git branch -m newbranchname
\end{lstlisting}
and for good measure check with \lstinline{git status}.

\begin{gitstep}{movemaster.runout2}
  Rename this branch.
\end{gitstep}

\Level 0 {Adding and changing files}
\label{sec:hg-push}

\Level 1 {Creating a new file}

If you create a file it does not automatically become part of your repository.
This takes a sequence of steps.
If you create a new file, and you run \n{git status},
you'll see that the file is listed as `untracked'.

\begin{gitstep}{firstfile.runout1}
  Create a file; it will initually be untracked
\end{gitstep}

You need to \n{git add} on your file to tell git that the file
belongs to the repository.
(You can add a single file, or use a wildcard to add multiple.)
However, this does not actually add the file:
it moves it to the \indexterm{staging area}.
The status now says that it is a change to be committed.

\begin{gitstep}{firstfile.runout2}
  Add the file to the local repository
\end{gitstep}

Use \lstinline{git commit} to add these changes to the repository.

\begin{gitstep}{firstfile.runout3}
  Commit these changes
\end{gitstep}

\Level 1 {Changes to a file in the repository}

The \n{git add} and \n{git commit} commands need to be repeated
if you make any changes to a file in the repository:

When you make changes to a file that has previous been added and committed,
the \n{git status} command will list it as `modified'.

\begin{gitstep}{changefirst.runout1}
  Make changes to a file that is tracked.
\end{gitstep}

If you need to check what changes you have made, \n{git diff} on that file
will tell you the differences the between the edited, but not yet added or committed,
file and the previous commit version.

\begin{gitstep}{changefirst.runout2}
  See what the changes were wrt the previously commit version.
\end{gitstep}

You now need to repeat \lstinline{git add} and \lstinline{git commit} on that file.

\begin{gitstep}{changefirst.runout3}
  Commit the changes to the local repo.
\end{gitstep}

Doing \n{git log} will give you the history of the repository,
listing the commit numbers, and the messages that you entered on those commits.

\begin{gitstep}{changefirst.runout4}
  Get the log of all commits so far.
\end{gitstep}

\Level 0 {Undoing changes}

There are various levels of undo, depending on whether you have added or committed
those chaqnges. Or worse; see below.

\Level 1 {Undo uncommitted change}

If you have made a change, and you did \n{git add} on the file,
and you've done \n{git diff} to make sure;

\begin{gitstep}{undofirst.runout1}
  Make regrettable changes.
\end{gitstep}

Do \n{git checkout} on that file. This gets the last committed version
and puts it back in your working directory.

\begin{gitstep}{undofirst.runout2}
  Restore previously committed version.
\end{gitstep}

\Level 0 {Restore a file from a previous commit}

A more complicated scenario is where you have committed the change.
Then you need to find the commit id.

You can use \n{git log} to get the ids of all commits.
This is useful if you want to roll back to pretty far in the past.
However, if you only want to roll back the last commit,
use \n{git show HEAD} to get a description of just that last commit.

\begin{gitstep}{revertfirst.runout1}
  Find the commit id that you want to roll back.
\end{gitstep}

Now do:
\begin{lstlisting}
git checkout sdf234987238947 -- myfile myotherfile
\end{lstlisting}

\Level 1 {Undo a commit}

As above, find the commit number.

Then do \n{git revert sdlksdfkl2343} (with the right id).
This will normally open an editor for you to leave comments;
you can prevent this with the \n{--no-edit} option.

\begin{gitstep}{revertfirst.runout2}
  Use 'git revert' to roll back.
\end{gitstep}

This will restore the file to its state before the last
add and commit, and it will in generally leave the repository back
in the state it was before that commit.

\begin{gitstep}{revertfirst.runout3}
  See that we have indeed undone the commit.
\end{gitstep}

However, the log will show that you have reverted a certain commit.

\begin{gitstep}{revertfirst.runout4}
  But there will be an entry in the log.
\end{gitstep}

The \n{git reset} command can also be used for various
types of undo.

\Level 0 {Remote repositories and collaboration}
\label{sec:git-remote}

The repository where you have been adding files and changes with
\lstinline{git commit} is the \indextermsub{local}{repository}.
This is great for tracking changes, and reverting them when needed,
but a major reason for using source code control is collaboration
with others.
For this you need a \indextermsub{remote}{repository}.
This involves a set of commands
\begin{lstlisting}
  git remote [ other keywords ] [ arguments ]
\end{lstlisting}

We have some changes, added to the local repository
with \lstinline{git add} and \lstinline{git commit}

\begin{gitstep}{remotefile.runout1}
  Committed changes.
\end{gitstep}

We connect to some remote repository with
\begin{lstlisting}
  git remote add servername url
\end{lstlisting}
If you want to see what your remote is, do
\begin{lstlisting}
  git remote -v
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{gitstep}{remotefile.runout2}
  Connect local repo to a remote one.
\end{gitstep}

Finally, you can \lstinline{git push} committed changes to this remote.
Git doesn't just push everything here: since you can have multiple branches locally,
and multiple \indexterm{upstream}s remotely, you intially specify both:
\begin{lstlisting}
  git push -u servername branchname
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{gitstep}{remotefile.runout3}
  Push changes.
\end{gitstep}

\Level 1 {Multiple local repositories}

Let's see how changes from one local repository
propagate to another.
This can be because more than one person is working on a project,
or because one person is working from more than one machine.

We make one local repository in directory \n{person1}.

\begin{gitstep}{collab.runout1}
  Person 1 makes a clone.
\end{gitstep}

Create another clone in \n{person2}.
Normally the cloned repositories would be two user accounts,
or the accounts of one user on two machines.

\begin{gitstep}{collab.runout2}
  Person 2 makes a clone.
\end{gitstep}

Now the first user creates a file, adds, commits, and pushes it.
(This of course requires an upstream to be set,
but since we did a \lstinline{git clone},
this is automatically done.)

\begin{gitstep}{collab.runout3}
  Person 1 adds a file and pushes it.
\end{gitstep}

The second user now does
\begin{lstlisting}
  git pull
\end{lstlisting}
to get these changes.
Again, because we create the local repository by \lstinline{git clone}
it is clear where the pull is coming from.
The pull message will tell us what new files are created,
or how many other files were changes.

\begin{gitstep}{collab.runout4}
  Person 2 pulls, getting the new file.
\end{gitstep}

\Level 1 {Merging changes}

If you work with someone else, or even if you work solo on a project,
but from more than one machine, it may happen that there will be multiple
changes on a single file. That is, two local repositories have changes committed,
and are now pushing to the same remote.

In the following script we start with the same situation of the previous example,
where we have two local repositories, as a stand-in for two users,
or two different machines.

We have a file of four lines.

\begin{gitstep}{merge.runout1}
  We have a four line file.
\end{gitstep}

The first user makes an edit on the first line; we confirm the state of the file;

\begin{gitstep}{merge.runout2}
  Person 1 makes a change.
\end{gitstep}

This user pushes the change.

\begin{gitstep}{merge.runout3}
  Person 1 pushes the change.
\end{gitstep}

The other user also makes a change, but on line~4, so that there is no conflict;

\begin{gitstep}{merge.runout4}
  Person 2 makes a different change to the same file.
\end{gitstep}

This change is added with \lstinline{git add} and \lstinline{git commit},
but we proceed more cautiously in pushing: first we pull any changes made by others with
\begin{lstlisting}
  git pull --no-edit
  git push
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{gitstep}{merge.runout5}
  This change does not conflict, we can pull/push.
\end{gitstep}

Now if the first user does a pull, they see all the merged changes.

\begin{gitstep}{merge.runout6}
  Person 1 pulls to get all the changes.
\end{gitstep}

\Level 1 {Conflicting changes}
\label{sec:git-conflict}

There can be various reasons for git to report a conflict.
\begin{itemize}
\item You are trying to pull changes from another developer, but you have changes
  yourself that you haven't yet committed.
  If you don't want to commit your changes
  (maybe you're still busy editing)
  you can use \lstinline{git stash} to set your edits aside.
  You can later retrieve them with \lstinline{git stash pop},
  or decide to forget all about them with \lstinline{git stash drop}.
\item There is a conflict between your changes, and those you are trying to pull
  from another developer, or from yourself on another machine.
  This is the case we will look at here.
\item Very similar, there can also be conflicts between two branches you try to merge.
  We will look at that in section~\ref{sec:git-branch-merge}.
\end{itemize}

As before, we have directories \n{person1} and \n{person2}
containing independent clones of a repository.
We have a file of four lines long, but contrary to above,
we now make edits that are too close together for git's
auto-merge to deal with them.

\begin{gitstep}{conflict.runout1}
  The original file.
\end{gitstep}

Now developer~1 makes a change on line~1.

\begin{gitstep}{conflict.runout2}
  With apologies for some scripting trickery,
  we use an edit by \indextermunix{sed}, changing \n{1} on line~1 to \n{one}.
  We add, commit, and push this change.
\end{gitstep}

In the meantime, developer~2 makes another change, to the original file.
This change can be added and committed to the local repository
without any problem.

\begin{gitstep}{conflict.runout3}
  Change the \n{2} on line two to \n{two}.
  We add and commit this to the local repository.
\end{gitstep}

However, if we try to \n{git push} this change to the remote repository,
we get an error that the remote is ahead of the local repository.
So we first pull the state of the remote repository.
In the previous section this led to an automatic merge;
not so here.

\begin{gitstep}{conflict.runout4}
  The \n{git pull} call results in a message that the automatic mere failed,
  indicating what file was the problem.
\end{gitstep}

You can now edit the file by hand, or using some merge tool.

\begin{gitstep}{conflict.runout5}
  In between the chevron'ed lines you first get the \n{HEAD},
  that is the local state, followed by the pulled remote state.
  Edit this file, commit the merge and push.
\end{gitstep}

\Level 0 {Branching}

With a \indexterm{branch} you can keep a completely
separate version of all the files in your project.

Initially we have a file on the \lstinline{main} branch.

\begin{gitstep}{devbranch.runout1}
  We have a file, committed and all.
\end{gitstep}

We create a new branch, named \n{dev}
and check it out
\begin{lstlisting}
  git branch dev
  git checkout dev
\end{lstlisting}
This initially has the same content.

\begin{gitstep}{devbranch.runout2}
  Make a development branch.
\end{gitstep}

We make changes, and commit them to the current branch.

\begin{gitstep}{devbranch.runout3}
  Make changes and commit them to the dev branch.
\end{gitstep}

If we switch back to the \n{main} branch,
everything is as before when we made the \n{dev} branch.

\begin{gitstep}{devbranch.runout4}
  The other branch is still unchanged.
\end{gitstep}

We can inspect differences between branches with 
\begin{lstlisting}
  git diff branch1 branch2
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{gitstep}{devbranch.runout5}
  We can check differences between branches.
\end{gitstep}

\Level 1 {Branch merging}
\label{sec:git-branch-merge}

One of the points of having branches is to merge
them after you have done some development in one branch.

We start with the four line file from before.

\begin{gitstep}{devmerge.runout1}
  The main branch is up to date.
\end{gitstep}

Also as before, we have a \n{dev} branch that contains
these contents.

%% \begin{gitstep}{devmerge.runout2}
%%   Make a development branch.
%% \end{gitstep}

We switch back to the \n{main} branch and make a change.
This will not be visible in the \n{dev} branch.

\begin{gitstep}{devmerge.runout3}
  On line~1, change \n{1} to~\n{one}.
\end{gitstep}

We switch to the \n{dev} branch and make another file.
The change in the main branch is indeed not here.

\begin{gitstep}{devmerge.runout4}
  On line~4, change \n{4} to~\n{four}.
  This change is far enough away from the other change,
  that there should be no conflict.
\end{gitstep}

Switching back to the \n{main} branch, we use
\begin{lstlisting}
  git merge dev
\end{lstlisting}
to merge the \n{dev} changes into \n{main}.

\begin{gitstep}{devmerge.runout5}
  Merge the dev branch into the main one with \n{git merge}.
  Note the `auto-merge' message,
  and confirm that both changes to the file are there.
\end{gitstep}

If two developers make changes on the same line, or on adjacent lines,
git will not be able to merge
and you have to edit the file as in section~\ref{sec:git-conflict}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.4]{git-push}
  \caption{Add local changes to the remote repository.}
  \label{fig:git-push}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.4]{git-pull}
  \caption{Get changes that were made to the remote repository.}
  \label{fig:git-pull}
\end{figure}

\Level 0 {Conflicts}

\begin{purpose}
  In this section you will learn about how do deal with conflicting
  edits by two users of the same repository.
\end{purpose}

Now let's see what happens when two people edit the same file.
Let both students make an edit to \verb+firstfile+, but one to the
top, the other to the bottom. After one student commits the edit, the
other can commit changes, after all, these only affect the local repository.
However, trying to push that change gives an error:
\begin{verbatim}
%% emacs firstfile # make some change
%% hg commit -m ``first again''
%% hg push test
abort: push creates new remote head b0d31ea209b3!
(you should pull and merge or use push -f to force)
\end{verbatim}
The solution is to get the other edit, and commit again. This takes a 
couple of commands:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
%% hg pull myproject
searching for changes
adding changesets
adding manifests
adding file changes
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files (+1 heads)
(run 'hg heads' to see heads, 'hg merge' to merge)

%% hg merge
merging firstfile
0 files updated, 1 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
(branch merge, don't forget to commit)

%% hg status
M firstfile
%% hg commit -m ``my edit again''
%% hg push test
pushing to https://VictorEijkhout:***@bitbucket.org/
                       VictorEijkhout/my-project
searching for changes
remote: adding changesets
remote: adding manifests
remote: adding file changes
remote: added 2 changesets with 2 changes to 1 files
remote: bb/acl: VictorEijkhout is allowed. accepted payload.
\end{verbatim}
}

This may seem complicated, but you see that Mercurial prompts you 
for what commands to execute, and the workflow is clear, if you refer
to figure~\ref{fig:hg}.

\practical{Do a \n{cat} on the file that both of you have been editing.
You should find that both edits are incorporated. That is the `merge'
that Mercurial referred to.}{}{}

If both students make edits on the same part of the file, version
control can no
longer resolve the conflicts. For instance, let one student insert a
line between the first and the second, and let the second student edit
the second line. Whoever tries to push second, will get messages
like this:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
%% hg pull test
added 3 changesets with 3 changes to 1 files (+1 heads)
(run 'hg heads' to see heads, 'hg merge' to merge)
%% hg merge
merging firstfile
warning: conflicts during merge.
merging firstfile incomplete! 
    (edit conflicts, then use 'hg resolve --mark')
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 1 files unresolved
use 'hg resolve' to retry unresolved file merges 
    or 'hg update -C .' to abandon
\end{verbatim}
}

For git:
\begin{verbatim}
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <name of some file>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
[solutions-mpi-c:955] emacs <name of some file>
[solutions-mpi-c:956] git add !$ && git commit -m "fix conflict" && git pull && git push
\end{verbatim}

There are now the following options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is usually a way to indicate whether to use the local or
  the remote version.
\item There are graphical programs to resolve conflicts. They will
  typically show you 3 colums, for the two versions, and for your
  resolution. You can then indicate `take this from the local version,
  and this from the remote'.
\item You can also edit the file to resolve the conflicts yourself. We
  will discuss that shortly.
\end{enumerate}

Both  will give you several options. It is easiest to resolve the
conflict with a text editor. If you open the file that has the conflict
you'll see something like:
\begin{verbatim}
<<<<<<< local
aa
bbbb
=======
aaa
a2
b
>>>>>>> other
c
\end{verbatim}
indicating the difference between the local version (`mine') and the
other, that is the version that you pulled and tried to merge.
You need to edit the file to resolve the conflict.

After this, you tell hg that the conflict was resolved:
\begin{verbatim}
 hg resolve --mark
%% hg status
M firstfile
? firstfile.orig
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
git add <name of that file>
git commit -m "fixed conflict in <name of that file>"
\end{verbatim}
After this you can commit and push again.
The other student then needs to do another update to get the
correction.

For conflicts in binary files, git has a flag where you can indicate
which version to use:
\begin{verbatim}
git checkout --ours path/to/file
git checkout --theirs path/to/file
\end{verbatim}

Not all files can be merged: for binary files Mercurial will ask you:
\begin{verbatim}
%% hg merge
merging proposal.tex
merging summary.tex
merking references.tex
 no tool found to merge proposal.pdf
keep (l)ocal or take (o)ther? o
\end{verbatim}
This means that the only choices are to keep your local version
(type~\n{l} and hit return) or take the other version (type~\n{o} and
hit return). In the case of a binary file that was obvious generated
automatically, some people argue that they should not be in the
repository to begin with.

\Level 0 {Inspecting the history}

\begin{purpose}
  In this section, you will learn how to view and compare files in the
  repository.
\end{purpose}

If you want to know where you cloned a repository from, look in the
file \n{.hg/hgrc}.

The main sources of information about the repository are \n{hg log}
and \n{hg id}. The latter gives you global information, depending
on what option you use. For instance, \n{hg id -n} gives the local revision
number.
\begin{itemize}
\item [\texttt{hg log}] gives you a list of all changesets so far,
  with the comments you entered.
\item [\texttt{hg log -v}] tells you what files were affected in each changeset.
\item [\texttt{hg log -r 5}] or \n{hg log -r 6:8} gives information on
  one or more changesets.
\end{itemize}

To see differences in various revisions of individual files, use
\n{hg diff}. First 
make sure you are up to date. Now do \n{hg diff firstfile}. No
output, right? Now make an edit in \n{firstfile} and do \n{hg diff
  firstfile} again. This gives you the difference between the last
commited version and the working copy.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \midrule
  mercurial&git\\
  \midrule
  \n{hg diff <file>}&
  \n{git diff HEAD <file>}\\
  \n{hg diff -r A -r B <file>}&
  \n{git diff A..B <file>}\\
  \midrule
\end{tabular}

For example:
\begin{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \n{pull} command tells you what the previous and current
  commit identifiers are; and
\item With \n{diff}, specifying these identifiers, you get the changes
  in \indextermunix{diff} format.
\end{itemize}

Check for yourself what happens when you do a commit but no push, and 
you issue the above diff command.

You can also ask for differences between committed versions with
\n{hg diff -r 4:6 firstfile}.

The output of this diff command is a bit cryptic, but you can
understand it without too much trouble. There are also fancy GUI
implementations of hg for every platform that show you differences in
a much nicer way.

If you simply want to see what a file used to look like, do \n{hg
  cat -r 2 firstfile}. To get a copy of a certain revision of the
repository, do \n{hg export -r 3 . ../rev3}, which exports the
repository at the current directory (`dot') to the directory \n{../rev3}.

If you save the output of \n{hg diff}, it is possible to apply it
with the Unix \n{patch} command. This is a quick way to send patches
to someone without them needing to check out the repository.

\Level 0 {Branching}

Create branch:

\n{git checkout -b newbranch}

List available:

\n{git branch}

After that switch:

\n{git checkout branchname}

\n{git push --set-upstream origin newbranch}


See what branches there are: \n{hg brances}

See what branch you are working on: \n{hg branch}

Switch to a branch (this undoes local changes): \n{hg update -C branchname}

\Level 0 {Pull requests and forks}

Suppose you want to contribute changes to a repository,
but you don't have write permissions on a repository.
(Of course, you need to have read permissions to the repository
in order to make the changes.)
Lack of write permission means that you can not create a branch,
and push and merge it.
A \indexterm{pull request} is then a way to communicate
your changes so that they can be pulled, rather
than you pushing them.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  In github, creating a fork is made with a press of the `Fork' button.
\item
  Clone your fork.
\begin{verbatim}
git clone <original-url> repo-fork
cd repo-fork
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Make your edits in the cloned fork.
\item You need to keep your fork up to date with the original repo.
  First you connect the original repo as `upstream' to your fork:
\begin{verbatim}
git remote add upstream <original-url>
git remote -v # check on the state of things
\end{verbatim}
(the name `upstream' is the conventional name; it is not a keyword.)
\item
  Optionally, check out a branch. If you \texttt{git status}, you should see
\begin{verbatim}
On branch YourBranch
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/YourBranch.
\end{verbatim}
\item Keep your fork updated:
\begin{verbatim}
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master master # or specific branch
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

To make pull request:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new branch
\begin{verbatim}
git checkout -b YourChangesBranch
\end{verbatim}
\item 
  Make your changes and commit them:
\begin{verbatim}
git add file1 file2
git commit -m "changes summary"
\end{verbatim}
\item Push your changes to the origin, that is,
  your repo on github:
\begin{verbatim}
git push --set-upstream origin YourChangesBranch
\end{verbatim}
(remember that you didn't have write permission to the original repo!)
\item You probably now get a message with URL to visit for creating
  a pull request.
\end{enumerate}


\Level 0 {Other issues}

\Level 1 {Transport}

Mercurial and git can use either \texttt{ssh} or \texttt{http} as
\indexterm{transport}%
\index{ssh!as transport}%
\index{http!as transport}.
With Git you may need to redefine the transport for a \texttt{push}:
\begin{verbatim}
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:TACC/pylauncher.git
\end{verbatim}

You can change the transport with \n{git remote set-url}:
\begin{verbatim}
git remote -v # check current transport
git remote set-url origin git@hostname:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
git remote -v # verify changes
\end{verbatim}
