  \[ x_{n+1}=f(x_n) = \
  \begin{cases}
    2x_n&\hbox{if $2x_n<1$}\\
    2x_n-1&\hbox{if $2x_n\>1$}\\
  \end{cases}

\begin{frame}{Analysis}
  Multiply by two:
  \[ 
  \begin{array}{rll}
    &1.d_1\cdots d_t&\times 2^n\quad\hbox{$n<0$}\\
    \times 2\colon&1.d_1\cdots d_t&\times 2^{n'}\quad\hbox{$n'=n+1<1$}\\
  \end{array}
  \]
  Cases:
  \[ 
  \begin{array}{rlll}
    n'<0\colon&             1.d_1\cdots d_t&    \times 2^n&    \hbox{done}\\
    n'=0\colon&             1.d_1\cdots d_t&    \times 2^n&    \hbox{is more than one}\\
    \hbox{subtract~1}\colon&0.d_1\cdots d_t&    \times 2^n&    \hbox{is unnormalized}\\
    \hbox{normalize}\colon& d_1.d_2\cdots d_t0& \times 2^{n-1}&\hbox{if $d_1\not=0$}\\
    &                       d_2.d_3\cdots d_t00&\times 2^{n-2}&\hbox{if $d_1\not=0$}\\
  \end{array}
  \]
  Every time $2x_n>1$ you lose at least one significant digit.
