\sectionframe{Making your package discoverable through pkgconfig}

\begin{numberedframe}{How does pkgconfig work?}
Use the \n{PKG_CONFIG_PATH} variable:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ module show cxxopts 2>&1 | grep -i pkg
prepend_path("PKG_CONFIG_PATH","/work2/00434/eijkhout/cxxopts/intel23/lib64/pkgconfig")
\end{lstlisting}
\end{numberedframe}

\begin{numberedframe}{Write your own \texttt{.pc} file}
\indexcmake{configure_file} line in \n{CMakeLists.txt}:
\begin{lstlisting}
configure_file(
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}.pc.in
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}.pc
    @ONLY)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{numberedframe}

\begin{numberedframe}{Write your own \texttt{.pc} file'}
The \n{.pc.in} file:
\begin{lstlisting}
prefix="@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@"
exec_prefix="${prefix}"
libdir="${prefix}/lib"
includedir="${prefix}/include"

Name: @PROJECT_NAME@
Description: @CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION@
Version: @PROJECT_VERSION@
Cflags: -I${includedir}
Libs: -L${libdir} -l@libtarget@
\end{lstlisting}
Combination of built-in variables and your own:
\begin{lstlisting}
set( libtarget auxlib )
\end{lstlisting}
\end{numberedframe}
