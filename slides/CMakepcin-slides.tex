\subsectionframe{Making your package discoverable through pkgconfig}

\begin{numberedframe}{How does pkgconfig work?}
Use the \n{PKG_CONFIG_PATH} variable:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ module show cxxopts 2>&1 | grep -i pkg
prepend_path("PKG_CONFIG_PATH","/opt/cxxopts/intel23/lib64/pkgconfig")
\end{lstlisting}
\end{numberedframe}

\begin{numberedframe}{Write your own \texttt{.pc} file}
\indexcmake{configure_file} line in \n{CMakeLists.txt}:
\begin{lstlisting}
configure_file(
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}.pc.in
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}.pc
    @ONLY)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{numberedframe}

\begin{numberedframe}{Write your own \texttt{.pc} file'}
The \n{.pc.in} file:
\lstinputlisting{tutorials/cmake/pclib/pclib.pc.in}
Note the initial cap!

Combination of built-in variables and your own:
\begin{lstlisting}
set( libtarget auxlib )
\end{lstlisting}
\end{numberedframe}

\begin{numberedframe}{Installing the pc file}
\begin{lstlisting}
install(
    FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}.pc
    DESTINATION share/pkgconfig
)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{numberedframe}
