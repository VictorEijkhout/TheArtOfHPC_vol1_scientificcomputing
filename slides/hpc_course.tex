\begin{frame}{Justification}

High Performance Computing is a field that brings together
algorithms, software, and hardware. This course
conveys the basics of computer architecture,
scientific algorithms, and how to code
algorithms to make them efficient on current hardware.

\end{frame}


\Level 0 {Processor Architecture}
\input ProcessorArchitecture-slides

\Level 0 {Parallelism}

\begin{frame}{Justification}
  Parallelism can be approached in several different ways.
  This session will discuss data paralellism versus instruction parallelism,
  issues in shared memory parallelism, parallel programming systems,
  the interconnects of distributed memory paralellism,
  scaling measures.
\end{frame}

\input Parallelism-slides

\Level 0 {Computer arithmetic}

\begin{frame}{Justification}
  This short session will explain the basics of floating point
  arithmetic, mostly focusing on round-off and its influence
  on computations.
\end{frame}

\input ComputerArithmetic-slides

\Level 0 {Partial Differential Equations}

\begin{frame}{Justification}
  Partial differential equations are an important source of 
  large-scale engineering problems. Here we take a look at
  their computational aspects.
\end{frame}

\input PartialDifferentialEquation-slides.tex

\Level 0 {Linear algebra}

\begin{frame}{Justification}
  Many algorithms are based in linear algebra, 
  including some non-obvious ones such as graph algorithms.
  This session will mostly discuss aspects of 
  solving linear systems, focusing on those
  that have computational ramifications.

\Level 0 {High performance linear algebra}

\begin{frame}{Justification}
  Bringing architecture-awareness to linear algebra,
  we discuss how high performance results from
  using the right formulation and implementation of algorithms.

\begin{frame}{Justification}
  We briefly discuss two applications that,
  while at first glance not linear-algebra like, surprisingly 
  can be covered by the foregoing concepts.
